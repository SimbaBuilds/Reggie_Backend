#Project Overview
I am building a web application called Reggie that is a software product that will speed up workflows in the education admin space.
This is the back end of the applicaiton built in Python utilizing FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.

If there is specific API documentation you need to complete a task, please ask for it instead of guessing.
